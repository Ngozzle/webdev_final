		<p>A huge part of my life is listening to and making music. I started playing violin when I was little, but
			these days I play jazz guitar. I love the musical conversations and spontaneous creativity that can happen
			during a jazz tune. This is just a little slice of the thousands of songs that inspire me.</p>

			<h2>third wind</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">Pat Metheny Group - Still Life (Talking)</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jj3oi9K-EFM"></iframe>
			<p>My dad first played this jazz song for me when I was just starting to learn guitar. I was instantly
				hooked by this thing that sounded nothing like I've ever heard before. Pat Metheny is still my favorite
				guitarist, and I love to listen to the songs on this album over and over again.

			<p class="subtitle">count basie orchestra - basie swings standards (re-release)</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kxZXAPVIGMU?si=VkzNHurfBsPXMO9P"></iframe>
			<p>This is another album I'm nostalgic for. I enjoy all of the big-band songs on this album, but I like this
				one particularly for its uptempo swing groove and exciting shout chorus.</p>

			<h2>years of therapy</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">gordon goodwin's big phat band - life in the bubble</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YqkTPjLY7I"></iframe>
			<p>It's too bad that the "big band" genre never really gets broken down beyond that, because the stuff that
				modern big bands play is like night and day when compared to the classic song above. The Big Phat Band
				has so many creative tunes that push the definition of what big band music sounds like.</p>

			<h2>crystal silence</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">Chick Corea / Arr. by Mike Tomaro</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yowO6VlcbkE"></iframe>
			<p>I played this slower song at my school before I even heard the original. I know it's a bit silly, but to
				be honest, I like this arrangment maybe more than the original! I'm just disappointed the best recording
				I found of this version is the score read-along preview, since it isn't on any music streaming
				platforms.</p>

			<h2>against the fall of night</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">sungazer - against the fall of night</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bjY7gZq-DbI"></iframe>
			<p>As I've grown as a musician, I've realized how much I love jazz fusion specifically. Sungazer's music
				hits that math/prog feeling that no other band seems to capture quite the same way. Since this album
				released, I've been listening to the title track nonstop!</p>

			<h2>cascade</h2>
			<p class="subtitle">dave weckl band - multiplicity</p>
			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-IRYnizFAg"></iframe>
			<p>This song is my latest obsession — I've been learning Steve Weingart's keyboard solo on guitar, and it's
				a challenge! I love when 12/8 songs switch between 4/4 triplet grooves and 3/4 sixteenth note grooves,
				and this song does that <em>a lot.</em> It's almost like this was written for a drummer's band or
				something...</p>
