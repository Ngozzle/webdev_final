        <p>Over time, I've programmed lots of projects to learn and practice programming. After all, the fastest way to
            learn something is through hands-on experience, in my opinion. Unfortunately, none of these are released,
            nor am I continuing to work on any of them at the moment (except for one!). Step into the graveyard of my
            programming project journey.</p>

        <p>Language experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GDScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>

            <p class="subtitle">HTML, CSS, JS</p>
            <img src="images/rhu.png" alt="rhythm heaven university main menu">
            <p>To accompany a fangame I was making for the rhythm game series Rhythm Heaven, I created a website to
                serve as the main menu for downloading level files. While it was eventually cancelled due to copyright
                fears, I kept all the project files! At the end of the day, it was a fun project where I got to learn
                the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as how all 3 can combine to create an interactive website.</p>

            <p class="subtitle">Godot (GDScript)</p>
            <img src="images/keypunch.png" alt="keypunch start menu">
            <p>This was my first ever game made in the Godot game engine! The premise is to press each set of keys
                displayed on the on-screen
                keyboard to increase your time remaining. I've stopped working on it because the game loop itself was
                sort of one-note, but I really like the 1-bit art direction (which I'll probably reuse for some other
                future project!) and the overall game feel. Also, though it's not the one showed in the image, I created
                my own font that could be unlocked as a cosmetic option.</p>

            <img src="images/fretset-menu.png" alt="fretset app with menu ui showing">
            <p>It turns out that Godot has a very robust UI system akin to HTML that can be used alone to create an
                application. I used Godot to create an app to practice drop-2 chord voicings on guitar. It came in handy
                when I was practicing for my Applied Jazz jury performance! In this project, I got to learn more about
                UI design and MIDI integration in Godot.</p>

            <img src="images/fretset-mini.png" alt="fretset mini window">
            <p>Python was the first programming language I ever learned, so I prefer using it (or GDScript, with its
                similar but UI-oriented syntax) to prototype quick ideas. This version actually came after the
                original Fretset, but has less features since it focuses on drilling triad arpeggios rather than chord
                voicings. However, that didn't stop me from adding one feature I never got around to adding to the
                original Fretset: a score counter that counts how many arpeggios you've played.</p>

            <p>Reject front-end. Return to command line. This project was my midterm for my Intro to Java Programming
                class. Educator can view, add, edit, or remove multiple-choice questions to an exam, <em>and</em>
                students can take that exam and receive a score. There are obviously many limitations like the lack of
                saving and loading progress between sessions, but I thought it was a pretty successful midterm
                all in all.</p>

                the intent to be, like, released! The goal is to choose which cards to play and buy to maximize your
                coins and beat your opponents. I still have a long ways to go before I can even get to a full
                minimum-viable project, but it's been super fun to work on this thing! Look out for it online when it
                drops in like 10 years ;)</p>
