        <p>Hey! Looks like you stumbled onto my website. I'm currently a student in community college currently studying
            software engineering. I signed up for Intro to Web Development to learn more about front-end programming,
            and I'm really enjoying it! This website is my final project for that class, where I apply everything I've
            learned into one big
            grand finale. I've chosen to theme each page based off my interests and hobbies. I'm hoping to one day be
            famous
            enough to have a website of my own, so this is kind of like a prototype for that! Click on the links at the
            top
            of the page to visit the other pages of my website, or click down below. Take care!

            <p>I've built lots of <a href="projects.html">projects</a> to learn and practice
                programming. I believe the fastest way to learn something is through hands-on experience.</p>

                violin when I was little, but these days I play jazz guitar. Check out some songs that inspire me!</p>

                have a digital place to keep them.</p>
